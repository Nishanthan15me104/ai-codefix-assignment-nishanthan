CWE-798: Hardcoded Secrets Fix Recipe (Java, Python, etc.)
Hardcoded credentials (passwords, API keys, tokens) are a critical security flaw. They should be stored outside the source code, especially in version control.

### FIX
1. **Remove the secret** from the source code file.
2. **Replace the constant variable** with a function call to a secure external source.

**Recommended External Sources (in order of preference):**
* **Cloud Secret Manager:** (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, HashiCorp Vault).
* **Environment Variables:** Best for non-cloud/local deployment, e.g., `os.getenv('DB_PASSWORD')`.
* **Configuration Files:** If unavoidable, use a file that is restricted via `.gitignore` and has minimal permissions, but this is less secure than the first two.

**Example (Java):**
Vulnerable:
private static final String DB_PASS = "Pa$$w0rd123";

Fixed:
private static final String DB_PASS = getSecretFromConfig("DB_PASS"); // Assumes getSecretFromConfig retrieves from an environment variable or vault.
